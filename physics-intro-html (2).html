    <h1>Journey into Physics: Understanding Our Universe</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Where everyday mysteries meet scientific wonder</p>
    
    <p>Imagine you're holding a basketball, ready to shoot. As you release it, something invisible guides its path through the air. That invisible force is gravity—and it's just one of many fascinating phenomena that physics helps us understand.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="phys_image1.png" alt="Forces acting on a basketball in flight">
        <p class="caption">The hidden forces at play when you shoot a basketball</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>What Is Physics?</h2>
    
    <p>Physics is the science that asks "why?" and "how?" about everything around us. Why does ice float? How do magnets stick to your refrigerator? What makes the sky blue? Physics seeks to uncover the fundamental rules that govern our universe, from the tiniest particles to the largest galaxies.</p>
    
    <div class="concept-box">
        <strong>Key Idea:</strong> Physics describes the universe using mathematical relationships called <em>laws</em>. These laws help us predict what will happen—like knowing exactly where a basketball will land based on how you throw it.
    </div>
    
    <h2>The Building Blocks: Matter and Energy</h2>
    
    <p>Everything in the universe is made of two fundamental ingredients: matter and energy. Matter is the "stuff"—atoms and molecules that make up everything from air to zebras. Energy is what makes things happen—it's the ability to cause change or do work.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="phys_image2.png" alt="Matter and energy transformation examples">
        <p class="caption">Matter and energy in action: from chemical reactions to motion</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here's something amazing: Einstein discovered that matter and energy are actually two forms of the same thing! His famous equation E=mc² tells us that a tiny bit of matter contains an enormous amount of energy—which is why the sun can shine for billions of years.</p>
    
    <div class="question-box">

    <h2>Forces: Nature's Invisible Hands</h2>
    
    <p>Forces are pushes or pulls that can change an object's motion. You experience forces constantly—gravity pulling you down, friction slowing your bike, or magnetism holding notes on your fridge.</p>
    
    <div class="concept-box">
        <strong>Newton's Big Insight:</strong> An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at the same speed and direction—unless a force acts on it. This is why astronauts float in space: without gravity or air resistance to slow them down, they keep moving!

    <h2>Waves: Energy in Motion</h2>
    
    <p>Waves are one of nature's most elegant ways of transporting energy. When you speak, sound waves carry your voice across the room. When you see a rainbow, you're witnessing light waves being separated by water droplets. Even the warmth you feel from the sun arrives as electromagnetic waves.</p>

        <p class="caption">Waves all around us: from ocean waves to WiFi signals</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here's a fascinating fact: all electromagnetic waves—radio, microwave, visible light, X-rays—travel at exactly the same speed: the speed of light (300,000 kilometers per second). The only difference between them is their wavelength!</p>

    <h2>The Quantum World: Where Things Get Weird</h2>
    
    <p>At the scale of atoms and smaller, the universe behaves in ways that seem almost magical. Particles can be in multiple places at once, act differently when observed, and even affect each other instantly across vast distances.</p>
    
    <div class="concept-box">
        <strong>Mind-Bending Fact:</strong> In the quantum world, particles don't have definite positions or speeds until we measure them. It's like a coin that's both heads and tails until you look at it!

    <p>This isn't just theoretical—quantum mechanics is why computer chips work, how lasers produce their pure light, and why the sun can fuse hydrogen into helium. The weird quantum world underlies all the technology we use daily!</p>
